Mayor De Blasio wants to add 300,000 housing units to the city. Where and how many could go in your neighborhood? What extra services (e.g. transit and roads, schools, emergency services) would be needed to accommodate the increased population?
You may work in teams of up to 3 students to develop your presentation, which has 2 parts:

A 60-second lightning presentation (upto 2 slides) that contains who is on the team, the neighborhood you chose, and a brief description of your solution to how much additional housing, and what additional services would be needed, and
A computer "poster" (aka a github site) consisting of a website with a description of your neighborhood, an analysis of where additional housing could go, and details about the additional services.
